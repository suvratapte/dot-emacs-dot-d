;; These customizations make it easier for you to navigate files,

;; "When several buffers visit identically-named files,
;; Emacs must give the buffers distinct names. The usual method
;; for making buffer names unique adds ‘<2>’, ‘<3>’, etc. to the end
;; of the buffer names (all but one of them).
;; The forward naming method includes part of the file's directory
;; name at the beginning of the buffer name

;; ido-mode allows you to more easily navigate choices. For example,

;; name, ido will narrow down the list of buffers to match the text
;; you've typed in
